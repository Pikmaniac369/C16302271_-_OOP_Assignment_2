USE AN ARRAY AND MODULUS -1 FOR CALCULATING THE RESULTS OF DICE ROLLS! FOR EXAMPLE:
	int[] dice = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,............,100];
	Random rand = new Random();
	int diceRoll = rand.Next(1, 101);
	int result;
	
	if(it's a d4 that's rolled)
	{
		result = (diceRoll % 4) - 1;
	}
	else if(it's a d6 that's rolled)
	{
		result = (diceRoll % 6) - 1;
	}
	............for every type of dice
	
	return result;





USE ABSTRACT CLASSES OR INTERFACES FOR THE CHARACTER CLASSES! FOR EXAMPLE:

	abstract class DnDClass
	{
		int level;
		
		
	}

	class Warlock : DndClass
	{
		
	}
KEEP IT SIMPLE! DON'T DO SUBCLASSES/ARCHETYPES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!









CREATE A CharacterStorage FOLDER!!!!!! SEARCH IT AND RETURN A MESSAGE THAT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TO FIND IF NOTHING IS THERE!!!!!!!!
ELSE RETURN THE NAMES OF ALL THE CHARACTER SHEETS IN THE FOLDER!!!!!
IF MAKING IT SO THEY CAN BE EDITED, STORE THEM IN AN ARRAY AND DISPLAY TO THE USER FOR WHICH ONE THEY'D LIKE TO CHANGE!!!!



MAKE OVERRIDIBLE METHODS FOR HIT POINT CALCULATION ETC... IN THE DnDClass CLASS AND OVERRIDE THEM IN THE Warlock, Wizard...etc. CLASSES!!!!!!!!!!
