The repository for my second Object-Oriented Programming Assignment: A simple character sheet creator for Dungeons and Dragons.

##DISCLAIMER
I am in no way associated or affiliated with Wizards of the Coast or Derek Banas. This application was created solely for the purpose of a College Assignment.

### Assignment Description
My assignment is called CharacterSheetCreator. As the name implies, it is a program for creating and reading text files that function as basic Character Sheets for Dungeons & Dragons. The user can create a character very quickly by entering the character's name, age, sex, race and class. The program uses this information to generate the character's proficiencies and to randomly generate character stats, all while staying within the rules of character creation in Dungeons and Dragons.

### Technologies Used
I made this assignment using C#. I had no prior knowledge of C# so I had to spend some time learning it. To do this, I watched ["C# Tutorial" by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lisiwUZJXqQ) and took down lots of notes which I have included to demonstrate my learning.
